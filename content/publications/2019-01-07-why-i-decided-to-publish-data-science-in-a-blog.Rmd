```{r setup, include = FALSE, error=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      comment = "#>",
                      collapse = TRUE,
                      error = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,

## Introduction
As I announced last week, my blog is now online at http://blog.oilgainsanalytics.com. LinkedIn may obfuscate the link so I am also providing it as an image below. Clicking on the image will bring you to the blog.

## Motivation
I believe in the sharing philosophy of data science as I learned it from my bioscientist instructors at Johns Hopkins University (Peng, Leek, Caffo, et al). There are so many career-changing lessons that you could pick up with these professors at Coursera. Data Science is a whole multidisciplinary, or should I say interdisciplinary as in [Wikipedia][1], field that combines statistics, mathematics, computer science, and data engineering that gives you the power to dig deep into your data and make astonishing discoveries.

I felt the need of an online website that could support [Rmarkdown][2] instead of copying and pasting code and pictures to [LinkedIn][3] every time.

## Under the hood
This blog uses the [R][R] package [blogdown][blogdown], an application that converts [markdown][markdown] and Rmarkdown to Html and Javascript, making easier for me to run code and publish it immediately as it exactly is written. 

One of the articles I am preparing on `multiwell statistics` -coming in few days-, will be written in Python and R together using [RStudio][rstudio] IDE[^ide]. It will be about running statistical methods on datasets originated by batch automation produced by communicating with the production optimization software [Prosper][prosper] via [OpenServer][openserver].

Still, I will continue publishing in LinkedIn but the extended, best and more current version of the post running with R and Python code will be in the blog.

## A quick demonstration

```{r}
library(reticulate)
reticulate::py_config()
```
