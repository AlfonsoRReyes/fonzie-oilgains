1. I would start by identifying acute problems in your area of expertise (**domain**): production , reservoir, drilling, completions, geophysics, chemistry, seismic, geophysics, etc., that you feel could be resolved by applying data science.

2. They may be big problems or small ones. Start with the small ones, or break the big ones in **manageable pieces** that you can address one step at a time.

3. Once you have two or three data science "project" candidates, start applying the basics to solve the problem. There is **no magic formula** that fits all the data science projects.


4. What I am trying to tell you is that you study Data Science at the same time that you are **solving a real world problem**. That's how I learned.


5. Before you embark in a formal education in Data Science or [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), as **MsC** or **PhD**, **try first with the online courses**, and have a taste of it. Then, if you fall in love with DS, move on the most expensive path -and at the same gratifying-, of studying in a university.


6. I recommend the online classes in Coursera by [Johns Hopkins](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=johns%20hopkins%20data%20science) university. They have a [specialization on data science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) and has a **rigorous approach**. I have the best of experiences with Johns Hopkins. The instructors are all PhDs and they share all what they know.


7. [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) is different from other things that I have studied over the years in the sense that is a **multidisciplinary career**: it requires from you to review, and study deeper, math, statistics, matrix algebra, computer science, and even physics; and read a lot material: papers, books, chapters, articles.


8. I published an article a little while ago on how to **turn Petroleum Engineers in Data Science wizards**. Here is the link:  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/transforming-petroleum-engineers-data-science-wizards-reyes/


9. Regarding coding and scripting in R or Python, just keep in mind this: you **don't have to be an expert programmer** to be a good data scientist; you have to know enough to use it as part of your toolbox. Same as with statistics or math; you don't need to be an expert statistician or a math wiz to do data science, but you have the learn the essentials, the fundamentals, to apply it in your **business solutions**. Of course, knowing and learning more opens your mind in approaching a problem in innovative ways.


10. Data Science is the beginning of something bigger: **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence**. I know all of this may sound like a lot. But as they say, any long journey starts with the first steps. If you fall in love with data science, it will bringing you rewards in your career as a petroleum engineer.
