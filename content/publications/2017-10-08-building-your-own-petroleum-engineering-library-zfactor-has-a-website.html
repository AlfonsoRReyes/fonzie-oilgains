<p>I just upgraded the package zFactor today. I added a new feature that converts the entire R package to a website to navigate through its pages of analysis and report. In fact, it was very simple. There is a package called pkgdown that turns any R package in a website using the same GitHub repository.</p>
<p>To access the zFactor package as a website just click on this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://f0nzie.github.io/zFactor/" class="uri">https://f0nzie.github.io/zFactor/</a></p>
<p>If you recall, zFactor makes a comparison among the most used compressibility factor correlations for hydrocarbon gases. here I am showing just two of them:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># plot</code></pre>
<p>The blueish it is, the most accurate at that range. MAPE is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error. Each of the correlations has its own table of statistical errors for comparison.</p>
<div id="what-you-can-do-with-zfactor" class="section level1">
<h1>What you can do with zFactor</h1>
<ul>
<li>Find z with any of the correlations provided</li>
<li>Get values from the Standing-Katz chart at any of the isotherms limited by the pseudo-reduced pressures (Ppr) digitized</li>
<li>Find what isotherms or pseudo-reduced temperatures (Tpr) are available from the Standing and Katz chart</li>
<li>Find what pseudo-reduced pressure points are available</li>
<li>Plot any of the Standing-Katz isotherms to view z in graphical form</li>
<li>Plot a tile chart to show the range of applicability of the correlations. In essence, get an idea of the accuracy by the location of the desired point at Tpr and Ppr</li>
<li>Get a statistics table when comparing any of the correlations to the Standing-Katz chart</li>
<li>Get a matrix of z values calculated from any correlation where the rows are the pseudo-reduced temperatures and the columns the pseudo-reduced pressures</li>
<li>Plot one or multiple isotherms</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to learn more about the package you could go and click on Vignettes where you will see these additional articles:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># figure</code></pre>
<p>In the next days I will be submitting the latest changes to CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network).</p>
<p>All the code, functions, notes, datasets are available via GitHub. Just click on the GitHub icon on the right of the menu bar.</p>
