I just upgraded the package zFactor today. I added a new feature that converts the entire R package to a website to navigate through its pages of analysis and report. In fact, it was very simple. There is a package called pkgdown that turns any R package in a website using the same GitHub repository.

To access the zFactor package as a website just click on this link:

https://f0nzie.github.io/zFactor/

If you recall, zFactor makes a comparison among the most used compressibility factor correlations for hydrocarbon gases. here I am showing just two of them:

```{r}
# plot
```


The blueish it is, the most accurate at that range. MAPE is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error. Each of the correlations has its own table of statistical errors for comparison.

# What you can do with zFactor
+ Find z with any of the correlations provided
+ Get values from the Standing-Katz chart at any of the isotherms limited by the pseudo-reduced pressures (Ppr) digitized
+ Find what isotherms or pseudo-reduced temperatures (Tpr) are available from the Standing and Katz chart
+ Find what pseudo-reduced pressure points are available
+ Plot any of the Standing-Katz isotherms to view z in graphical form
+ Plot a tile chart to show the range of applicability of the correlations. In essence, get an idea of the accuracy by the location of the desired point at Tpr and Ppr
+ Get a statistics table when comparing any of the correlations to the Standing-Katz chart
+ Get a matrix of z values calculated from any correlation where the rows are the pseudo-reduced temperatures and the columns the pseudo-reduced pressures
+ Plot one or multiple isotherms


If you want to learn more about the package you could go and click on Vignettes where you will see these additional articles:

```

In the next days I will be submitting the latest changes to CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network).

All the code, functions, notes, datasets are available via GitHub. Just click on the GitHub icon on the right of the menu bar.
