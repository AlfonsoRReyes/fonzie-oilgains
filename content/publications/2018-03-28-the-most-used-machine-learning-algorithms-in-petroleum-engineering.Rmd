Continuing with the article on machine learning (ML), from the papers extracted in OnePetro, I have been able to detect the use of these ML algorithms:

* Neural Network

* Genetic Algorithm

* Support Vector Machine

* Principal Component Analysis

* Linear Regression

* Fuzzy Logic

* Hierarchical

* K-Means

* Singular Value Decomposition

* Decision Tree

* Support Vector Regression

* Deep Learning

* Logistic Regression

* Boosting

* Random Forest

* Nearest Neighbor

* Discriminant Analysis

* Gaussian Mixture

* Gaussian Process Regression

* Naive Bayes

* Hierarchical Clustering

* Reinforcement Learning

* K-Nearest Neighbor

* Hidden Markov

* C-Means

* Fuzzy C-Means

* Gaussian Mixture Model

* Kernel Density Estimation

* Gradient Boosting Tree

* Kernel Approximation

With a little bit of R magic:

```{r, out.width = "1200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/most_used_ml_algorithms_01.jpg")
```

From all these techniques, the top 20 most used are:

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/most_used_ml_algorithms_02.png")
```


If you see I am forgetting a specific machine learning algorithm, please let me know.

> Notes. (1) Fuzzy-Logic is not considered a ML technique; rather, belongs to control theory. But still, I am including it here because there is a considerable number of papers using the algorithm. (2) I grouped Convolutional Neural Networks with "Deep Learning".

So, this is the state of use of machine learning in petroleum engineering.
