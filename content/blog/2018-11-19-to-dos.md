1. Add image to blog post. Same as in `publications`.

2. Add description and link to latest `publications`. Now, they are just showing the images.

3. Change ABSTRACT  button to MORE (read more) in `publications` summary.

4. Remove sidebar in `Portfolio`: *"Some of these portfolio files were given more than once, but to avoid repetition, repeats are not always listed"*

5. Change *Why I write this* and *Looking for help?* in `Blog` index page.
