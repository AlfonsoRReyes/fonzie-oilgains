I have had my notes here and there: Evernote, network drives, LinkedIn, SPE forums. And I could never find the ideal way to put the data and info together until I found Hugo.


 [Blogdown documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) 

I borrowed the template ideas for my blog from [Ron J. Hyndman blog](https://robjhyndman.com/).

The source code for the site is now [hosted on github](https://github.com/alfonsorreyes/fonzie-oilgains).

If you find any problem in this site, please feel free to [let me know at](mailto:Alfonso.Reyes@oilgainsanalytics.com).


Some useful resources were:

  * Amber Thomas's [blog post](https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/) on making a website using blogdown, hugo and github pages.
  
  * Justin Dunham's [blog post](http://justindunham.net/migrating-from-wordpress-to-hugo/) on migrating wordpress content to hugo.
