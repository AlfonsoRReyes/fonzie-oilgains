Read from an [article](https://medium.com/@devfire/how-to-become-a-devops-engineer-in-six-months-or-less-366097df7737) yesterday how learning the Cloud is a must if you are in data science and machine learning. I made some annotations:

Although the article is a discussion on DevOps, there are parts that go beyond and touch data science and machine learning interests.

That was just in case you thought you had it hard learning Python or R.

The article is named *How To Become a DevOps Engineer In Six Months or Less*.
