It is always a pleasure to help Petroleum Engineering colleagues with data science questions. You can send me message via Twitter and LinkedIn. Please, be patient, if I don't go back to you quick; I may be traveling.

These are very useful sources to find answers. They have helped me a lot:

* Questions on data analysis: [crossvalidated.com](http://crossvalidated.com).

* Questions about R: [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com).


I will appreciate if you send me feedback on the packages and software I have published to the corresponding package `Issues` section in its repository.
