There is also a very controversial issue in this article such as hashtag#Windows ecosystem is the comfort zone of developers and people alike. 
If you are serious about hashtag#ApplicationDevelopment in hashtag#DataScience, hashtag#MachineLearning and hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence -, then you have to be get out of the comfort zone and start doing it in hashtag#Linux. The terminal means reproducibility. 

Start with practicing Linux an hour a day. No?

OK. What about about couple of hours a week, but there is no way around it. Linux is 90%+ of cloud, servers, mobile, portable, non-passive sensors in the oilfield, and will be of any new device with embedded intelligence onshore and offshore. 

Think about it!
