There is also a very controversial issue in this article such as Windows ecosystem is the comfort zone of developers and people alike. 
If you are serious about Application Development in Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence -, then you have to be get out of the comfort zone and start doing it in Linux. The terminal means reproducibility. 

Start with practicing Linux an hour a day. No?

OK. What about about couple of hours a week, but there is no way around it. Linux is 90%+ of cloud, servers, mobile, portable, non-passive sensors in the oilfield, and will be of any new device with embedded intelligence onshore and offshore. 

Think about it!
