The Eclipse reservoir models from the Volve dataset working like a charm. The compressed file is 399 MB in size.

I was able to open the models with ResInsight (thank you [Matthew Kirkman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAD01-wB7lEC1xekjxKlzTRAcP5SNTNvhwo/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_details_shares%3BFgtbhW3cSPyO0PLFB88xRw%3D%3D)). The software is open source and relatively easy to use.

Here is the Eclipse case opened.
