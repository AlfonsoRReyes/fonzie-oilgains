No, I am not travelling or anything like that. I am actually half done writing the tutorial for the multiwell-stats application in Python. I will be writing it using the magnificent tools of data science, so we have a fully reproducible document. My pick for writing tutorials, booklets and books is #bookdown. It is an #rstats package that lets you combine math, code and text in the same document. 

Remember, data science is about reproducibility, as in reproducible research.
