<p>Read from an <a href="https://medium.com/@devfire/how-to-become-a-devops-engineer-in-six-months-or-less-366097df7737">article</a> yesterday how learning the Cloud is a must if you are in data science and machine learning. I made some annotations:</p>
<p>Although the article is a discussion on DevOps, there are parts that go beyond and touch data science and machine learning interests.</p>
<p>That was just in case you thought you had it hard learning Python or R.</p>
