## Data Analytics and Production Optimization Projects

### Current

- Performing the analysis of the Volve public dataset published by Equinor. So far, was able to download thirteen out of fourteen datasets. The last one is 2.6 terabytes size. Most of the data is readable such in the cases of production data, reservoir data, drilling real time data. Other data is binary but readable such in the case of seismic data but there are two open source applications for that purpose segyio in Python and OpendTect. Writing a tutorial for public consumption and reproducibility.

- Writing an application for production optimization combining Python and R. The first part, multiwell statistics is almost completed (preparing for publication). The next modules are multiwell scanning, well test quality control, well network optimization, and VLP/IPR matching from tests.

- Plans for publishing rNodal, a small application for nodal analysis that has already been written (read below). This should be the starting point for petroleum engineers to start coding more in R, as they will use it as a base application or template to model their own packages.



### Past

- Wrote an application in R to communicate with GAP and OpenServer in order to generate automated forecasts by field, by tank, by well. The application was named rGAP. 2018

- Wrote an application using R to communicate with MBAL and produce curves not able to be generated by MBAL itself. The data was read from MBAL and converted to tidy datasets that would be used to generate material balance plots. The action was remotely initiated from a web server at request of the user without the need to interface directly with MBAL. The application was called rMBAL. 2018

- Wrote an application in R that talked directly with Prosper via OpenServer with the intention of reading hundreds of wells directly from Prosper models. This operation created a tidy dataset for subsequent analysis in preparation for machine learning algorithms. The application was named rProsper. 2018.

- Prepared the conceptual of an application for dual gas lift simulation using R and rProsper. The idea was replicate the original application written in Excel in 2015. Functions for dual gas lift operations were written but not tested with real well cases. 2018.

- Showed the operator and contractor on how to remotely operate Prosper, GAP and MBAL living in a Citrix server via a web interface. This was a breakthrough for the organization because finally the operator learned how to control applications via an API. 2018

- Wrote an application that run nodal analysis using known VLP and IPR correlations. The purpose was showing petroleum engineers how to write modular applications in R and the use of algorithms for looping in vertical and inclined strings. The application was called rNodal. Unpublished. 2017

- Wrote an application in R to remotely collect paper searches from OnePetro and put the results in datasets for analysis and interpretation. The application  name was petro.One. It is available via CRAN. 2017

- Wrote a comparison paper and an application in R that put together all the correlations to calculate the gas compressibility factor. The application was named zFactor and was published in CRAN. 2017.

- Wrote a scientific application in R to solve ordinary differential equations. The intention of the applications was to teach physics and engineering students on how to start writing applications in R; also get them familiar with object orientation using S4. The application was named rODE and is published in CRAN. 2017

- Built a multiwell scanner application able to read hundreds of wells from Prosper models creating a dataset for statistical analysis, quality control of the input data and outlier detection of well variables. This work reduced the time for building a whole network model for a field from 6-9 months to 3-5 weeks. The application was built in Python and used Petex OpenServer. 2014.

- Built a network scenarios selector using GAP, OpenServer and Python Jupyter notebooks. This application allowed the engineer to create multiple scenarios in a worksheet that later would be read automatically. The well network would be optimized and the best solution (highest oil production, less gas injection rate, lowest THP), would be suggested and presented in graphical form in the notebook. 2015.

- Built a small well test matching application using Excel, Python and OpenServer. The well test data would be read via SQL from an Oracle database and plugged in to a worksheet. The user would enter the external conditions, other well parameters (PVT, VLP, IPR correlations), and with a push of a button, the matching process would proceed until convergence. 2016.

- Built an application using Jupyter notebooks to interrogate the master production database in Oracle in order to get the most current information about production of the wells. The notebooks work as templates that engineers could modify with their own field, well name and conditions. With these queries the engineer could immediately know what gas lift wells were producing  at the highest oil rate with the less gas injection volumes; how many wells had been idle the longest and were good oil producers; what wells had the highest GOR and watercut; what caused an oil well to drop production; what wells were the highest consumers of injection gas but were poor oil producers; etc. 2015

- Built a small application using Python, OpenServer and Prosper to plot all the VLP and IPR curves intersection at once. The output data was captured from Prosper models and placed on a worksheet. By seeing all the plots at once, the engineer could know what wells were producing at their best, what wells risk with stopping production, measure the quality of the matching process; and what wells required attention.

- Built a prototype application using Prosper and OpenServer to simulate dual gas lift wells. The application was written in Excel VBA. Its main innovations was allowing the user to open two simultaneous Prosper instances, where one instance represented the long string, and the second instance the short string. The main objective of the application was to detect multipointing in dual gas lift wells. 2015.

- Wrote an internal white paper were all the fields of the operator were analyzed to pick the field candidates for production optimization. The paper was instrumental for the creation of a task force (well modeling team) and start an initiative of continuous field optimization. The paper cited numerous papers of cases where oil and gas operators had used production modeling gaining oil increase from 3% up to 24%. 2013.
